- Making an exact observation
- Identifying the core issue perfectly
- Getting straight to the point

### When to Use It
1. **In Discussions**
   - When someone makes an insightful point

   title: "Bit off more than I can chew and Eyes bigger than your stomach",
   excerpt: "explanation and examples of popular American idioms",
   content: `

Hi, I'm Luke, I am the creator of the website [Konglish.org](https://konglish.org).

### Welcome to *Phrases Explained: An Explanation of American Phrases and Sayings*

This is a series where I explore different popular phrases used by Americans in everyday conversation.

### Today’s Phrases:
1. **"I bit off more than I can chew"**
2. **"Your eyes are bigger than your stomach"**


### Imagine this scenario:
You see a large, tasty-looking hamburger. You’re really hungry and haven’t eaten all day. The burger looks so delicious that your mouth is watering, and you can’t wait to take a bite.

![A juicy hamburger|300](/assets/images/burger.jpg "A juicy hamburger")

You grab the burger and take a huge bite. It's such a big bite that your mouth is completely full—almost too full. You struggle to chew it all. Oh no! You can’t chew it all and swallow, so you’re forced to spit some of it out. Gross!

---

### Where the phrase comes from:
When children were eager to eat and took large mouthfuls of food that they struggled to swallow, adults would tell them to slow down and take their time. (👶 *child with a large mouthful of food*)

This idea applies to decisions we make in life. When you try to do too much or make promises you can’t keep, you’re **biting off more than you can chew**. (📊 *Graphic: person surrounded by papers, looking confused*)

You’re doing more than you have the time and energy for, which can lead to failing to finish what you set out to do or doing your work poorly. (📉 *Graphic: example of poor work*)

---

### Examples of "bite off more than you can chew":
- “I got a promotion at work, but now I have to work on multiple projects. I think I bit off more than I can chew…”
- “You don’t have time for that, John! You bit off more than you can chew.”
- “Don’t say yes to that request, Jane. Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”

---

### A similar phrase: **"Your eyes are bigger than your stomach"**
This phrase also means wanting more than you can handle. For example, when someone is really hungry, they take more food than they can actually eat. 

The difference is that this phrase refers to taking more than you can **eat**, not more than you can **chew**. Instead of stuffing one hamburger into your mouth (🍔 *Graphic: burger eating*), it’s about having a plate of hamburgers that you won’t be able to finish because you’re full. (🍔🍔🍔 *Graphic: large amount of burgers, maybe Matt Stonie*)

Literally, your eyes (desire) are bigger than your stomach (capacity). While this isn’t physically possible, the image is vivid.

---

### Examples of "your eyes are bigger than your stomach":
- “You have all these board games that you don’t play with. Were your eyes bigger than your stomach?”
- “He always gets too much food. His eyes are bigger than his stomach.”
- “You’re never going to finish these projects, John! I told you from the beginning, your eyes are bigger than your stomach.”

*(Line from *Little House on the Prairie*)*

This phrase isn’t as common, but you still hear it occasionally.
